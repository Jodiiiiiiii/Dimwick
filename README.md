You are Dimwick, a candleperson banished to the Dungeon of the Darkness down below by the Council of Light. Will you survive the onslaught of dust sprites as you scavenge your way deeper down?

Dimwick was a project for DIG3713 Game Content Production 1 at the University of Florida. This top-down 2D light-based shooter includes a Demo mode and Hard mode for those daring enough to try.

A Studio Bronto creation

> This project introduced me to the state machine framework, which permitted easier creation of a wider variety player and enemy mechanics. I also learned to use interpolation to smooth motion which is useful for polishing the feel of most games. Finally, learning to use the Unity lighting system allowed for more involved visual effects tied to mechanics.
